# rsteam
Simple script for launching steam games with Rofi
![rsteam example](example.png)

## Usage
The only special dependancy that rsteam uses is rofi and it requires no configuration. rsteam quickly reads the manifest for each installed steam game and displays them on startup. All rsteam needs is to be put on the system's PATH and ran.
